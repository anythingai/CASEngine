## Data Processing Pipeline

### Core User Flow

1. **Input Processing**: User submits cultural "vibe" through intuitive search interface
2. **Theme Expansion**: LLM analyzes and expands the vibe into related keywords, entities, and cultural contexts
3. **Taste Correlation**: Qloo AI maps expanded themes to correlated cultural entities across multiple domains
4. **Parallel Asset Discovery**: Simultaneous queries to CoinGecko and OpenSea for relevant tokens and NFTs
5. **Social Analysis**: Real-time trend analysis across Google Trends and Farcaster platforms
6. **Results Aggregation**: Orchestration service combines all data sources, applies relevance scoring, and generates actionable insights
7. **Visualization**: Frontend renders interactive taste graphs, signal cards, and optional portfolio simulations

### Data Flow Sequence

```
User Input (vibe) → Theme Expansion (LLM) → Taste Correlations (Qloo) →
Asset Discovery (CoinGecko + OpenSea + Social) → Results Aggregation →
Scoring & Ranking → Interactive Visualization → User Insights
```
